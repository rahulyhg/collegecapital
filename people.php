        <h3>College Capital was founded by a shared desire to build an effective aggregation platform for brokers to operate within.</h3>
        <p>This entailed the combination of four successful asset finance broker groups coming together to form College Capital. </p>
<p>The founding parties â€“ <a href="http://www.allfreightfinance.com.au/" target="_blank">Allfreight Finance</a>, Leasing Consultants Group, <a href="http://www.mainlandfinance.com.au" target="_blank">Mainland Finance</a> and <a href="http://www.moneyresources.com.au/" target="_blank">Money Resources Group</a> are all successful and well established businesses in their own right. </p>
        <p>They identified an opportunity to create a unique tripartite aggregation model designed to benefit:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Broker</li>
          <li>Financier</li>
          <li> Client</li>
        </ul>
        <p>College Capital is supported by a hands-on General Manager, Leanne Walsh, who with her extensive financial background can provide the endorsement you need to operate in today's dynamic financial services environment. </p>
        <p>Leanne is well supported by Gabrielle Hashmonai, who has a strong background in financial services Administration. Gabrielle is working within the business to provide operational support to our members.
